# Changelog

## 0.1.11 — hara 0.122.2 trust boundaries and resilient input

- Bundle the released hara CLI `0.122.2`, with explicit trust boundaries for project configuration,
  permissions, profiles, sensitive files, Git history, subprocess environments, and external agents.
- Make coding, search, checkpoint, semantic-index, cron, process-tree, and gateway file handling more
  robust against concurrent replacement, stale state, unbounded work, and unsafe attachment paths.
- Keep Chinese/Japanese/Korean IME composition inside the composer: pressing Enter to accept an active
  composition no longer selects an autocomplete item or sends the message prematurely.
- Require Node.js `22.12.0` or newer only for PATH-based CLI fallback, with an actionable upgrade
  message on older runtimes; the bundled desktop sidecar remains self-contained.

## 0.1.10 — hara 0.122.0 lifecycle and file-safety hardening

- Bundle the released hara CLI `0.122.0` with cancellable agent/tool-round lifecycles and reliable
  failure propagation for headless, plan, review, and organization runs.
- Harden `hara serve` shutdown, discovery, compaction, approval cancellation, and concurrent session
  locking while keeping persisted session secrets redacted.
- Make coding and file operations safer around symlinks, inode replacement, FIFOs/devices, rollback,
  undo, large snapshots, searches, and concurrent external edits.
- Bound gateway subprocesses, queues, media downloads, rate-limit state, and daemon shutdown so a
  stuck provider or child process cannot pin the desktop service.

## 0.1.9 — hara 0.121.0 sidecar and connection hardening

- Bundle the released hara CLI `0.121.0`, including `hara desk`, crash-safe coding/file edits,
  bounded large-file/tool output, composer history, and cold-start improvements.
- Cancel superseded WebSocket connection attempts so a stale socket cannot replace the active
  session after reconnecting or switching servers.
- Pin CI sidecar builds to the exact `v<SIDECAR_VERSION>` CLI tag and fail release builds when the
  desktop, Cargo, Tauri, lockfile, Git tag, or bundled CLI versions drift.
